## Website - [Canawin.ca](https://Canawin.ca){:target="_blank"}


### Quick Summary

Canawin.ca is a website about window blinds and Shades.


### Stack Used for creating Canawin.ca
 1. Html
 2. Css
 3. Github
 4. AWS LightSail
 5. AWS Route 53
 6. Let's encrypt
 

### How website used to deployed in traditional way

I have used [AWS lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/){:target="_blank"} to deploy this Website and use [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"} for domain name configuration. It's a straightforward Website, nothing fancy about it. Simple, I created a couple of HTML pages, added CSS to them, and deployed them in AWS with the help of lightSail and route 53. The final ingredient is that  I used the [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org){:target="_blank"} bot to make the Website secure (HTTPS)ðŸ”“. Voila, the Website is ready and is live.


### Problem I faced

Creating a website in HTML and CSS is not rocket science. But the main problem starts when you need to make the same changes in 2 or more files. For example- the header and footer need to be fixed on all pages. For any changes on these files, I need to copy-paste the header and footer HTML code on all pages, and the second one is the deployment part. Whenever I push code to GitHub, I need to manually login to the server and pull from Github for the latest changes.

### Solution

For the first page, I can make use of a Static Site generator like [jeklly](https://youtu.be/T1itpPvFWHI?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB){:target="_blank"} and for the second part I can make use of GitHub action
