## Website - [Techness.ca](https://techness.ca)

### Quick Summary
Hi, This post is about technical details of **Why**  and **How** I created techness.ca.
* What Stack I have used?


I don't want another tutorial website. My aim to document all the technical aspects of my project, just like a technical journal.
This website is where I can write all the problems I faced while doing the project, the solution to them, and most importantly, what I have learned from the project. And what all mistakes not to repeat in the next project.

P.S - I will keep updating to this post as I am still improving the techness.ca and working on it to add new feature.

### Stack Used for creating Techness.ca
 1. Jekyll (SSG aka Static Site Gnerator )
 2. Github
 3. Github Page
 4. Dilinger (editor)


### What is Static Site Generator, and Why have I used it?
Let's start with the basics. If I want to create a simple website with a few pages, the traditional way is to create one or two HTML pages and some CSS and javascript files.
Let's assume there are three pages 
1. Home
2. About 
3. Contact


I have to create a header and footer for all three mentioned pages.
If I want to change or fix something in the header or footer, I have to make changes on all three pages, which is a pain in the neck when the website grows.
